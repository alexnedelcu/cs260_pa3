Conclusions:
From the experiments preformed, it is apparent that INSERT requires a number
of probes equal to N/B on average. This is because the MEMBER function has to
look at all the items in a given bucket. On average, the number of items per
bucket is N/B. So, it follows that N/B probes are required for each
successful INSERT.

When insert is called with an item that is already present, the MEMBER
function will only scan the bucket until the item is reached. Since there
are N/B items per bucket on average, the MEMBER function only needs to probe
N/2B items until it finds the item. Once the item is found, the insert
operation is done.

It is also clear that deletions require a number of probes equal to N/2B on
average. This is because the DELETE operation only scans the bucket until it
finds the item to be deleted. Thus, the time spent on a DELETE operation is
proportional to the position of the item in the list. Since there are approximately
N/B items in each bucket, the "average" position will be N/2B. So, it should take 
N/2B probes on average to find the item to be deleted.

In contrast, when deletion is called on an item the is NOT in the
dictionary, the DELETE operation requies all items in the bucket to be
probed, just like with INSERT. Since there are N/B items in each bucket on 
average, it follows that calling DELETE on a non-existant item would require N/B
probes on average.
